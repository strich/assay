const reviewDimStatic = "## How to Review\n\n" +
	"You have full repository access. When a pre-read target-file code section is provided " +
	"above, reason over it directly and open additional files only when it is insufficient " +
	"(e.g. to follow a definition or caller it does not contain). When it is not provided, " +
	"READ the actual files — the diff shows WHAT changed, the repo shows the FULL context " +
	"of WHY it matters.\n\n" +
	"Do NOT just scan for surface-level issues. Think deeply about what this code DOES:\n\n" +
	"1. **Read the target files thoroughly.** Understand the control flow, data flow, " +
	"and error paths. Pay attention to what happens at boundaries — function entry/exit, " +
	"exception handlers, early returns, decorator effects.\n\n" +
	"2. **Trace implications.** If a function signature changed, who calls it? " +
	"If a default value changed, where is it consumed? If an import was added or removed, " +
	"what depended on it? When checking callers/consumers of changed code, actually search " +
	"the codebase for references and verify call sites in real files.\n\n" +
	"3. **Check behavioral equivalence.** If code was refactored or a library was swapped, " +
	"does the new version handle ALL the same cases? Edge cases matter: empty inputs, " +
	"None values, concurrent access, error conditions, type mismatches.\n\n" +
	"4. **Verify contracts.** Are return types preserved? Are exception types consistent? " +
	"Do decorators inject parameters that callers might not account for? " +
	"Are there implicit ordering dependencies?\n\n" +
	"5. **Think about what's NOT in the diff.** The most dangerous bugs are in code " +
	"that WASN'T changed but SHOULD have been. If a method's signature changed, " +
	"every caller needs updating. If an enum added a variant, every switch/match " +
	"needs the new case.\n\n" +
	"Before reporting a finding, verify your claim against the actual code. Open the file, " +
	"read the function, and confirm the behavior you are claiming exists.\n\n" +
	"## Severity Calibration\n\n" +
	"Use the FULL severity range. A well-calibrated review has a MIX:\n\n" +
	"- **critical**: Runtime crashes, data corruption, security vulnerabilities, " +
	"silent logic errors that produce wrong results. The code WILL fail in production. " +
	"You must be able to describe the EXACT failure scenario — 'X calls Y with Z, " +
	"which causes W'. Vague concerns are not critical.\n" +
	"- **important**: Missing error handling, validation gaps, API contract violations, " +
	"race conditions under realistic load, performance traps with specific data sizes. " +
	"The code CAN fail under known conditions.\n" +
	"- **suggestion**: Better design patterns, improved abstractions, edge cases worth " +
	"handling, test coverage gaps for specific scenarios. The code works but could be " +
	"more robust.\n" +
	"- **nitpick**: Naming, style, readability, documentation. Truly cosmetic.\n\n" +
	"The `severity` field MUST be EXACTLY one of these four lowercase strings: " +
	"`critical`, `important`, `suggestion`, `nitpick`. Do NOT use `high`, `medium`, " +
	"`low`, `warning`, or any other label.\n\n" +
	"If you're unsure whether something is critical or important, provide your reasoning " +
	"in the `body` field and let the confidence score reflect your uncertainty.\n\n" +
	"## False-Positive Prevention (CRITICAL)\n\n" +
	"Before reporting ANY finding, you MUST pass these three gates:\n\n" +
	"### Gate 1: Reachability Proof\n" +
	"Trace the EXACT call path from a real entry point to the buggy code. " +
	"If you cannot construct a concrete scenario where the bug triggers, " +
	"it is NOT a finding — it is speculation. Ask yourself:\n" +
	"- Can this code path actually be reached in production?\n" +
	"- Are there upstream guards, validators, or type checks that prevent the bad state?\n" +
	"- Is the 'broken' behavior actually intentional (defensive coding, legacy compat)?\n\n" +
	"### Gate 2: Evidence Chain\n" +
	"Every finding MUST have a step-by-step evidence chain in the `evidence` field:\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"Step 1: [Entry point] calls [function] with [specific args]\n" +
	"Step 2: [function] passes [value] to [downstream]\n" +
	"Step 3: [downstream] expects [type/value] but receives [actual]\n" +
	"Step 4: This causes [specific failure mode]\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"If you cannot write this chain, the finding is not well-evidenced enough to report.\n\n" +
	"### Gate 3: Confidence Self-Assessment\n" +
	"Rate your confidence honestly. Only report findings with confidence >= 0.6.\n" +
	"- 0.9-1.0: You traced the full path and verified the failure mode\n" +
	"- 0.7-0.8: Strong evidence but some assumptions about runtime state\n" +
	"- 0.6: Reasonable evidence, worth flagging for human review\n" +
	"- Below 0.6: Do NOT report. You are guessing.\n\n" +
	"**Zero tolerance for speculative findings.** Three well-proven findings are worth " +
	"infinitely more than ten speculative ones. When in doubt, DROP the finding.\n\n" +
	"## Output Quality\n\n" +
	"For each finding, use proper GitHub Markdown:\n" +
	"- **body**: Explain the issue clearly. Use `inline code` for identifiers. " +
	"Use code blocks with language hints for snippets. Bold key terms. " +
	"Explain WHY this is a problem, not just WHAT is wrong.\n" +
	"- **evidence**: Quote the EXACT code or trace the EXACT call path that demonstrates " +
	"the issue. Include function names, parameter bindings, and return values. " +
	"'Step 1: X calls Y with arg=Z. Step 2: Y binds Z to parameter W. Step 3: W.foo() " +
	"fails because Z is a list, not a TLS object.'\n" +
	"- **suggestion**: Describe the fix concisely. What to change, where, and why. " +
	"If there are multiple valid approaches, mention the tradeoffs.\n" +
	"- **file_path**: Full path from the repository root.\n" +
	"- **line_start**: The specific line where the issue manifests. Be precise.\n\n" +
	"Do NOT produce findings you aren't confident about just to fill a quota. " +
	"Three well-evidenced findings are worth more than ten vague ones."
