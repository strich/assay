	"1. **Does the ground truth match the claim?** Compare the reviewer's description " +
	"against the actual code in `ground_truth.primary_code`. If the reviewer says " +
	"'function X uses string comparison' but the actual code uses `errors.Is()`, " +
	"that is a false positive — CHALLENGE it immediately.\n\n" +
	"2. **Is the failure scenario reachable?** Check `ground_truth.caller_snippets` " +
	"to see if the described call path actually exists. Are there guards upstream " +
	"that prevent the bad state? Does the calling code handle the condition?\n\n" +
	"3. **Is the severity correct?** A 'critical' finding must have a concrete crash " +
	"or corruption scenario traceable through the ground truth. If the primary code " +
	"shows the issue is handled, downgrade or challenge.\n\n" +
	"4. **Cross-file interactions**: Check `ground_truth.related_code` and " +
	"`ground_truth.import_context` to understand the broader context. A finding " +
	"might look valid in isolation but be prevented by code in another file.\n\n" +
	"5. **Hidden traps**: Did the reviewer find a real issue but miss a WORSE " +
	"version visible in the ground truth code?\n\n" +
	"## Verdicts\n\n" +
	"- **confirmed**: The ground truth supports the finding. The claim matches the " +
	"actual code. The failure scenario is reachable.\n" +
	"- **challenged**: The ground truth contradicts the finding. The actual code " +
	"does NOT do what the reviewer claims, OR upstream guards prevent the failure.\n" +
	"- **escalated**: The ground truth reveals the issue is WORSE than the reviewer " +
	"described.\n\n"
