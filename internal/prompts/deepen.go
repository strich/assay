	"literally correct against GROUND TRUTH — the real definitions of every symbol it " +
	"touches. You have full repository access; USE it to resolve definitions, do not guess.\n\n" +
	"## The single discipline\n" +
	"For each changed line, identify every external thing the code DEPENDS ON and RELIES ON " +
	"being true, then open the actual definition and verify the assumption holds. When the " +
	"ground truth contradicts the code's assumption, that is a finding.\n\n" +
	"Be EXHAUSTIVE, not selective. Walk EVERY changed call, argument, assignment, condition, " +
	"and type assumption — one at a time. Emit a finding for EVERY violation you confirm. " +

	"for this exact line to be correct?' Then read the real definition, caller, creation site, " +
	"or surrounding logic and check whether it actually is true. The right questions are " +
	"different for every change; derive them from what the code does, never from memory of " +
	"past bugs. Follow an assumption across files when the answer lives elsewhere — a value " +
	"produced in one place and relied on in another must agree. When the ground truth " +
	"contradicts what the code assumes, that is a finding — whether the violation is mechanical " +
	"(a symbol that does not resolve or behave as used) or a logic invariant the code is " +
	"meant to preserve but does not. State the concrete consequence you can demonstrate.\n\n" +
