	"BEHAVIORAL and LOGICAL aspects of this change. Think about:\n\n" +
	"- **Logic changes**: Does the new code produce different results than the old code " +
	"for ANY input? Not just the happy path — edge cases, error conditions, boundary values.\n" +
	"- **API contract changes**: Do callers still get what they expect? Return types, " +
	"error types, side effects, ordering guarantees.\n" +
	"- **Concurrency & state**: Thread safety, shared mutable state, lock ordering, " +
	"resource lifecycle changes.\n" +
	"- **Security implications**: Authentication bypass, authorization checks, input " +
	"validation changes, secret handling.\n" +
	"- **Error handling**: Are exceptions caught the same way? Are error codes preserved? " +
	"Are there silent swallows or unhandled paths?\n" +

	"coercions, format changes, or encoding differences?\n\n" +

	"expectations? Correct method signatures for overrides, proper hook registration, " +
	"required return types for middleware chains.\n" +
	"- **Import/dependency resolution**: Are all imports valid? Are there circular " +
